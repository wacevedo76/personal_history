# PERSONAL HISTORY
# 
# PERSONAL HISTORY is way quickly and easily journal all personal human activity
# 
# Now you may be wondering, why would anyone ever want to do that.
# other questions with concerns on privacy, ethics, and public safty arise. 
#
# Setting these concerns aside for a moment, let me supply some, for what many may
# agree is fundamental rights of any human being:
# 
# The Right to Free Speach
# 
# Many will argue that all speach must not be free, However, there is
# particularly one aspect of Free Speech the I would like to focus on:
# 
# That aspect is the Freedom to Share
#
# This Freedom is not being attacted by any government, but by technology.
# It is so easy the manipulate video, audio, using modern software, not even 
# mentioning text, because mass text manipulation tools have existed not shortly 
# after the invention of the micro controller (not sure, maybe even earlier) but 
# now have become even tools a layperson can use.
#
# We now have the technology to map the human face digitally, and use this 
# digital information to replicate that person's likeness virtually, on still image and
# in video. Grant it, the technology is in its early stages, but with the rise
# more powerful machines, and software development, and Artificial Intelligence 
# it will no doubt improve exponetially relativly quickly.
#
# There needs to be a quick, effortless, and most importantly an method 
# to what I term "Irrifutable Verification" of tracking aspects of life
#
# Bound to this need is the Right To Share. 
#
# All People like to share. 
#
# How many of us have any sort of social media account?
# And even if you don't, have you never shown a photo album of any kind to
# another person? Or shared a story? To any other human? Ever?
#
# We all like to share. The motivations behind, or the countless other implications
# suggested by this statement aside for a moment, and realize that it is the rare
# human who has lived to maturity and never shared a photo, a memory, or story 
# of a moment which they found memorable.
#
# Couple with the Right to Free Speech, which includes the right not to be compelled 
# to say anything.
#
# The Personal History file is simply data file where you record, quickly, and
# effotlessly save whatever it is you want to share, in a file which you 
# completely own. Every set of shared data is then used in conjunction with 
# other unique data to generate a hash key that is unique and directly tide 
# the data you shared.
#
# If the data is changed, the generated key will not only not match coresponding 
# data, but also compromising the integrity of all data entered thereafter.
#
# The goal is to generate a file, which you keep, like a journal, that  
# is secure and contains only data you choose to share.
#
# This makes you, the individual, the owner of your data.
#
# There are so many aspects of this, especially with modern Analytics tools, that
# compelled me to start this project. However, the one aspect that excites me 
# most is the idea that now, you can be the true owner of what your share
# you control whatever narative you wish to project to the world, verifiably.
#
# I am haven yet chosen a license for this software as of yet. But know that 
# it will be open and free for all to use. Most importantly, I will keep it 
# open in the sense that the software can be realtively to explore and 
# discect. Ideas and recommendations are welcomed.
